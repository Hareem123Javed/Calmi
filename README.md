README: Design Approach for Calmi 
Calmi is a clean, calm, and supportive landing page designed for a mental health chatbot. The 
visual and interactive design choices aim to reflect empathy, emotional safety, and ease of use.  
Design Principles: 
Calm Aesthetic: Soft gradients with cool tones (#f1d9d1, #d0dce7, #f7faff) evoke comfort, 
peace, and clarity matching Calmi’s emotional purpose. 
Clean UI: Spacious layout, rounded elements, and smooth font choices contribute to a 
non-overwhelming, welcoming interface. 
Interactive Touches: 
● CTA buttons animate on hover to encourage interaction. 
● Feature cards subtly highlight on hover. 
● Testimonial slider brings human feedback into the user experience. 
● AOS (Animate On Scroll) library is used for subtle motion as elements appear, keeping 
users engaged. 
UX Focus: 
● The sticky navbar ensures navigation is always available. 
● A signup modal (popup form) keeps users on-page and simplifies conversion. 
● Accessibility and readability are prioritized with high-contrast text, semantic HTML, and 
minimal distraction. 
Responsive Design: 
The layout gracefully adapts for smaller screens with flexible containers and adjusted font sizes, 
ensuring usability across all devices.
